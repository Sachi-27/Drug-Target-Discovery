. Is it true that counts of number of drugs satisfy: all = biotech + nutraceutical + small_molecule?
No, there can be intersections, because a small molecule can be nutraceutical. So all <= B+N+SM is true. Also, each drug in the all set must belong to atleast one of B,N and SM.


Constructed drug class map as above. Note that the status of a drug the same across all of its targets. We have a total of 5954 drugs. DB12010 is the drug with largest number of targets = 303 human proteins

179 drugs are approved, but also have a label of either withdrawn or illicit. Such drugs we do not consider as approved

druginfo_updated.json contains information of drug status across different targets, based on March 2024 data
protein_drug_map.json contains information of all drugs for a protein 

2927 have non empty druglist for a protein, remainiing in the total of 20434 are categorised as non-druggable 
when excluding the illciit and withdrawn drugs, we have 2915 proteins with non empty druglist
of which 2233 have atleast one approved drug therefore categorising them as druggable
, rest 682 are categorised as investigational
